# Renewable metal reconstruction

Prepared armmakr has makesmetal=1 and energyuse=60; armmex has extractsmetal=.001
and energyuse=3. These differ from unconditional metalmake. The original loader
stores makesmetal as a byte at definition +0x22d and extractsmetal as float at
+0x1ce. The resource update gates maker/extractor output on its energy-payment
branch. Extractor setup at 0x437840 sums map-cell metal bytes (+7) plus one over
its footprint, then scales by extractsmetal into unit +0x58. These observations
identify next reconstruction work, not verified complete resource formulas.

The metal-maker healthy lifecycle now matches 606 native snapshots with supplied
Create/Activate/Deactivate times and build-percent/health reads. The oracle uses
existing FactoryReference shading/caching callbacks; the simple solar fixture
alone could not execute this script. No VM changes were needed. The comparison
includes poses, threads, static variables, shading/caching and spin state.

Run native_solar_reference.py --unit armmakr and compare_native_solar.gd with
-- --armmakr. The native suite includes this check. Live metal-maker income,
energy starvation, extractor map data and original settlement timing remain
unfinished. Do not treat the script comparison as proof of economic behavior.
